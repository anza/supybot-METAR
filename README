METAR - supybot metar wrapper
Prints weather report about <station> to IRC with PRIVMSG (works with MSG or on channels).

NOTE! This plugin works in very stupid way - by calling a system binary to parse the weather data. Wise people use improved version by nuteater which is completely written in python and uses python-metar for parsing weather: https://github.com/nuteater/supybot-METAR/
